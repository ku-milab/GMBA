# Age-Aware Guidance via Masking-Based Attention in Face Aging

## Overview

Face age transformation aims to convert reference images into synthesized images so that they portray the specified target ages. The crux of this task is to change only age-related areas of the given image while maintaining the age-irrelevant areas unchanged. Nevertheless, a common limitation among most existing models is the struggle to generate high-quality aging images that effectively consider both crucial properties. To address this problem, we propose a novel GAN-based face-aging framework that utilizes age-aware Guidance via Masking-Based Attention (GMBA). Specifically, we devise an age-aware guidance module to adjust age-relevant and age-irrelevant attributes within the image seamlessly. By virtue of its capability, it enables the model to produce realistic age-transformed images that certainly preserve the input's identities while delicately imposing age-related properties. Experimental results show that our proposed GMBA outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity preservation and accurate age conversion, as well as providing superior visual quality for age-transformed images.
